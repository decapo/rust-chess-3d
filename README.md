# Bevy Chess 

Learning Rust+Bevy following this tutorial from [guimcaballero/bevy_chess](https://github.com/guimcaballero/bevy_chess) originally 
written in bevy = "0.3.1" and bevy_mod_picking = "0.2.0". This repo is an update with bevy = "0.7.0" and  bevy_mod_picking = "0.6.1".

I am still learning Rust+Bevy so the code is not perfect, but it's functional.
